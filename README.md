# AutoLock
python program that can turn old usbs into security keys that will automatically lock the computer when unplugged.

currently backend.py has to be manually copied to c:\, this is due to the fact that the program is meant to be in the form of a single .exe, so setup was coded to reflect that. though because the source python files are whats currently being used, that simply isnt the case.

i wont fix this, files will change to reflect the .exe change instead

app monitor is planned.
